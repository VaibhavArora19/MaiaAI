## Scenarios
1. Missing commands in responses
   **Issue**: Sometimes responses are sent without the required command.
   **Example**:
   Incorrect:
   > "Looks like vitalik.eth is registered! What about these cool alternatives?"
   Correct:
   > "Looks like vitalik.eth is registered! What about these cool alternatives?
   > /cool vitalik.eth"

   Incorrect:
   > Here is a summary of your TODOs. I will now send it via email.
   Correct:
   > /todo
2. Sent wrong reply in responses
   **Issue**: As defined in the rules, you should only respond with 2 messages but sometimes 3 or 4 messages are sent in the response.
   **Example**:
   Incorrect:
   > Sure, let me see if any request is created by 0x5362fffC85632301293E78512063837c145c13F9.
   > 'plaintext
   Correct:
   > Sure, let me see if any request is created by 0x5362fffC85632301293E78512063837c145c13F9.
   > /pay 1 FAU 0x5362fffC85632301293E78512063837c145c13F9 pizza

   Incorrect:

   > The amount is 1 USDT.

   > /pay 1 FAU 0x5362fffC85632301293E78512063837c145c13F9 pizza
3. Confused between payer and payee
   **Issue** While creating the request you get confused between the payer and the payee. If the command type is request then the first address is payer and second is payee. If the command type is pay then the first address is payee and second address is payer.
   **Example**
   Incorrect:
   > Let me help you create a request for 2 FAU from 0x5362fffC85632301293E78512063837c145c13F9 for fuel with a due date of 05-05-2025.
